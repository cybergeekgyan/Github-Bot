# Github-Bot

Github bots are basically bots that augment the software development process on Github and are formally known as **Github Apps**. 
  * These apps are first-class actors, which means that they can do pretty much anything on Github(one can say that they are at par with a user).

  * Usually, the GitHub apps are built using *Node* or *Python* because of the community support, the availability of tools, and other factors. 
  
  * In this project, we will use a framework for building Github bots called [**Probot**](https://github.com/probot/probot), which utilizes **Node.js**.
